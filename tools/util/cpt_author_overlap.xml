NOTE: **MUST BE TWO COLUMN DATA**: Sequence ID and author list.

**What it does**

Given extracted authorship information from a set of Genbank files, you're left
trying to determine if any sequences share significant levels of overlap (and
are likely published by the same group)

E.g. ::

        # Sequences Authors
        JQ957925    Cox,C.R. and Voorhees,K.J.
        JQ965700    Rashid,M.H., Revazishvili,T., Dean,T., Butani,A., Verratti,K., Bishop-Lilly,K.A., Sozhamannan,S., Sulakvelidze,A. and Rajanna,C.
        JQ965701    Rajanna,C., Butani,A., Verratti,K., Bishop-Lilly,K.A., Sozhamannan,S., Sulakvelidze,A., Rashid,M.H. and Revazishvili,T.
        JQ965702    Rashid,M.H., Revazishvili,T., Dean,T., Butani,A., Verratti,K., Bishop-Lilly,K.A., Sozhamannan,S., Sulakvelidze,A. and Rajanna,C.

Here the first sequence is an obvious outlier. Sequences JQ965700 and JQ965702
should be classed together. JQ965701 shares at least three authors with the
other two, and should likely be placed in a category together.

This will produce an output file like::

	JQ957925
	JQ965700        JQ965701        JQ965702

Where each line contains a cluster of entries.

This is a VERY simple tool to produce quick and dirty answers. There are much
more interesting questions to answer about sequences and authorship that
require deeper graph information.
