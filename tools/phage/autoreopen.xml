This software relies on PhageTerm:

    PhageTerm software is a tool to determine phage termini and packaging mode from
    high throughput sequences that rely on the random fragmentation of DNA (e.g.
    Illumina TruSeq). Phage sequencing reads from a fastq file are aligned to the
    phage reference genome in order to calculate two types of coverage values
    (whole genome coverage and the starting position coverage). The starting
    position coverage is used to perform a detailed termini analysis. If the user
    provides the host sequence, reads that does not match the phage genome are
    tested on the host using the same mapping function. Source:
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/phageterm/.
