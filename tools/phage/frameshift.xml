**What it does**

Finds:

* locations near the end of a gene
* scans the -3 to -1 reading frames for possible ORF starts which:

  * have a reading frame at least half as long as the parent sequence
  * have at least 1 AA the same
  * have at least 4 nucleotides identical (this may be too opinionated)

and returns those as a new set of features, scored by their similarity to the canonical slippery sequence (XXXYYYZ)

In bacteriophage λ, this frameshift controls production of two proteins with overlapping sequences, gpG and gpGT, that are required for tail assembly. We developed bioinformatic approaches to identify analogous −1 frameshifting sites and experimentally confirmed our predictions for five additional phages. Clear evidence was also found for an unusual but analogous −2 frameshift in phage Mu. Frameshifting sites could be identified for most phages with contractile or noncontractile tails whose length is controlled by a tape measure protein. Phages from a broad spectrum of hosts spanning Eubacteria and Archaea appear to conserve this frameshift as a fundamental component of their tail assembly mechanisms, supporting the idea that their tail genes share a common, distant ancestry.
