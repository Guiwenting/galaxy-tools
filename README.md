# CPT Galaxy Phage Analysis Tools

Originally these tools were known as "CPT Portal", which then changed to "CPT Galaxy Utilties" as we migrated to galaxy. Now we're migrating to python, so we're renaming and reorganising the suite into a condensed set of utilities specific to phage analysis. More generic utilities will move into separate projects.
