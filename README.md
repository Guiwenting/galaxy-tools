# CPT Galaxy Tools

The Center for Phage Technology's Galaxy tools.

The repository quality is currently all over the place, so please don't use
this as examples of good practice or anything :) Eventually all of these tools
will be folded into one of the other large repositories for continued
maintenance, such as Bj√∂rn's
(galaxytools)[https://github.com/bgruening/galaxytools] or the IUC
(repo)[https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc]
